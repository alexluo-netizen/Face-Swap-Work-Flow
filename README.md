# Face-Swap-Work-Flow
Display the work flow of applying face swapping model to the target image and make series of images into a video, and adding watermark randomly at the corner.

Work Flow process:
1. Convert the object video to a seires of images.
2. Crop the images to 800 by 600.
3. Apply watermark to the corner for each frame randomly.
4. Convert the images to a full video.
5. Swap all the character face with the Marvel Captain anime face.
